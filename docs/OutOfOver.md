# Out the Oven


Run run as fast you can

But you can't catch me, I am too fast!!!

<br><br><br>

I am nimble, I be quick

I will jump over you with a snap & a twist..

<br><br><br>

I'm running away duck & dogs 

including cows & sheeps and frongs !!

<br><br><br>

I took turn left & right

but nothing takes away my delight..

<br><br><br>

Run run as fast as you can..

But you can't catch me, I am too fast!

<br><br><br>

Water! Water! Ohh no! Not now !

I don't mush! Let's turn back now !

<br><br><br>

Let's jump in water. Let's jump in now !

Don't want to be caught by an angry mob

<br><br><br>

There's a fox in the water !

There's fox right there ! Stop ! Stop !

<br><br><br>
What I am ???
