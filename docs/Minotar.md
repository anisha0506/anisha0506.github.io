# Theseus & the Minotar
Theseus and his father King Aegeus were very close. One day while they were enjoying a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/congenial" target="_blank">`congenial`</a> scenery in the palace 
garden, a woman came to visit the King Aegeus. 

She <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/beseech?s=t" target="_blank">`Beseeches`</a> the king not to send her son to Crete. Theseus didn't understand why she begged, so he asked his father.

He explained that everyday he sends 7 men and women to Crete. Then they were never seen them again. 

Rumor is that King Minos sends these people in a maze with a monster called "The Minotar".

Upon hearing this shocking news Theseus decided to take a place of the woman's son. 

"No", cried King Aegeus. 

"No, no, no !!!" you can't go. You will get eaten" said King Aegeus.

"But If I don't go other people will get eaten", said Theseus.

"Fine you may go", said the King Aegeus.

When they both reached the ship, Theseus asked, "Why the ship sail is black and white?".

King Aegeus explained, if Theseus came back alive he should turn the sail white. If he had been <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/slaughtered?s=t" target="_blank">`slaughter`</a>, 
the sail should be turned black.

Theseus said goodbye and set sail to Crete. 

After many days they arrived at Crete. Many people come to see Theseus. 

One was Aradaine, King Minos's daughter. She knew about her father, and she also knew she couldn't let Theseus die.

At midnight she went to Theseus and took him to entrance of the maze. 

She told him the secret, "Always turn the left".

Aradaines also gave him ball of string to find his way out. 

Then Theseus quietly went in <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/anticipating?s=t" target="_blank">`anticipating`</a> not to wake the Minotar. 

But the Minotar sniffed him. 

Out fo the shadow came "Bull Human with a hammer".

Theseus reached for a sword, but didn't have any !!

He would have to fight the Minotar with his bare hands....

It was a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/anticipating?s=t" target="_blank">`saga`</a> battle. Forces between good and evil fought.

But then Theseus picked up a stone & threw it at the Minotar and broke the skull of Minotar.

Now he had killed the Minotar, he would have to find the people of Athens who were lost in the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/labyrinth?s=t" target="_blank">`labyrinth`</a>.

On his way to exit, by following the string, he found the Athiens. Then all went to <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/egress?s=t" target="_blank">`egress`</a>. 

At the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/egress?s=t" target="_blank">`egress`</a>, they saw Aradaine. They all went to the ship and hurried on to the ship. They all set sail to Athens.

But halted at an island.

King Minos heard of this & got mad. He decided to chase them.

By next morning King Minos reached to the island. The Atheins fled to the ship & out run them, but forgot Aradaine.

Theseus tried to convenience them, but they knew they would get killed. 

Through all this excitement, Theseus forgot to turn the sail to white. King Aegeus saw this & thought Theseus has been
slaughtered. Upon seeing this King Aegeus decided not to live anymore. He flang himself into the sea. This sea is now called the Aegean Sea in Missisippi.
