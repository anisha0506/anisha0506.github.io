# Life's Taste in Sweetness

I'm the most fabulous thing,
until little kid dines on neem leaves..
<br><br><br>
When I'm quite, people say cats got me..
That's silly cats have their own.
<br><br><br>
All day long that silly wet thing bother me,
I'm glad I have a person to spit it all out.
<br><br><br>
I'm the most fantastic thing in the world
that is if you use me right..
<br><br><br>
I'm nice redish white, but I could be green or blue..
<br><br><br>
I covered in tiny bumps called tasty vasty vuds !
<br><br><br>
I just love to eat food all day, all night & dinner & lunch too..
<br><br><br>


What I am ???
