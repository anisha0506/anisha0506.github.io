# Case Of The Peculiar Pranks  ![](img/haha.png)


I entered into Principle's office & saw my best friend Mellisa & bunch of other Kids sitting on a bench.  

Mellisa Shouted, "I didn'nt do the prank, it was someone else"
    
Actaully no one did the prank. It was only because we were found in the spot with the evidence. 

Mellisa was found chewing gum & the Gym teacher found the chewing gum on equipment which stuck to his hand. 

I was sent to the principals office, because Miss Nobel got stuck to her chair with Honey & I had honey in my lunch bag. 

We all tried to convince the principal but everything seemed to be inefficacious.

Mrs Watson the principal's assistant, came in & said the parent are here to discuss the issue. 

As I heard my parent are coming to meet the Principal. My heart started pounding out of my chest. 

We all saw the parents and the principal go into separarte room. 

I was so curious.. 

I tried to overhear their converrsation. It went something like this... 

My mom asked "What is problem?" 

Principal replied, "Your childrens are voilating the School rules". 

One of the Parent asked "Which rules? Please be specific..."

The principal replied, "They are disrespecting teachers."

"Mentally or physically?" asked another Parent. 

"Both, I would say" Said the Principal. 

"Mr. Kong(My Dad), Your child has stuck a teacher to chair with honey" said Mr Mcgill.

"I strongly refuse to believe that !!!" said My dad.
    
Mr. Mcgill said, "Your child already has low grade. Same with all of you. They will be taken out of this school !!!"

Everyone was silent for a moment. 

I was horrified. Ohh no !!! Ohh no !!!  I was going to be taken out of this school !!! 

I was as worried as a mouse with it's tail cut off.

Mr. Mcgill talked to the rest of the parents. 

He councluded by saying "Your children will stay an extra hour to clean up the mess"

The Parents left & drove away. 

Mr Mcgill said, "Danny & Trevor to the library, Me and Mellisa to the gym and Aubree and Olivia to the Cafeteria"

We went out of the pricipals office to the defined spots.

But then I grabbed Mellisa's hand & hid out of principals sight.

"What are you doing?" Mellisa shouted. 

"I'm finding who set us up" I said, "Into the basement to plan..."

I went into Basement and Mellisa followed.  It was teneabrose. 

"Alrght ! Now what?" asked Mellisa.

Before I could answer, I spotted Danny's bag. 

We searched but found nothing, except a prank notebook !! Melissa was so mad!!!. 

Wait if .. " I said.

"Sarah! Mellisa! Your one hour is over !" it was Mr Mcgil shouting.

We quitely opened the door and tiptoed into the Gym. When Mr Mcgill came, we pretended to take the gum off the gym equipments. 

"Come on, Your one hour is finished. Are you not done yet?". "Ugh" he exclaimed.

We went home with out parents and got big talk about pranks and respecting teachers. 

The next day we ditched the class and went back in to basement.  

I told Mellisa how I knew, it wasn't Danny.

"If it was Danny, he wouldn'y have got in trouble" I said.

"You're right!" said Mellisa. 

Just then the door opened. It was the principal & the teachers. 

There was also a student with them but I didn't know who? 

Me and Mellisa hid behind the two barrels & overheard their conversation. 

"Mrs Blair, are you sure, you put the prank notebook in Danny's bag ?" questioned Mr Mcgill.

"Confirmative" said Mrs Blair. 

"Good !!! now miss Nobel did you get Melvin ?(The nerd!!) 

"Yes" said Miss Nobel.

"Great!!!" said Mr Mcgill.
 
"Melvin here is your reward for planting the evidences. 

"Thanks Mr. Mcgill" cheered Melvin.

"Teachers, today we will have a victory party". 
 
We will only have students with good grades & we can top Darwin middle school" exclaimed the Principal.

" No more Bad Grades !!" They all cheered. 

So it was never Danny. It was always the Principal. 

Then Mellisa noticed a security Camera. 

"Perfect !" I thought. 

After they left we took the camera recordings and mellisa recorded it in her Phone.

Then she posted it on all social Media apps :( 
    
It had gone viral !!! 

The Principal has been exposed !!! Case closed :)

Whoa ! Whoa !! Whoa !!! what happened to the teachers and Principal ??? 

They got fired by the board of directors. 

What happened to Melvin ? 

He was grounded for 3 Months. 

** The school was in peace... or was it ??? **
