# Smooth But Strong

Look at me, I'm very smooth but strong
<br><br><br>
My arms can hold anything..
The pillow who lay on me are like fans
<br><br><br>
I'll sign autographs all around.
Ohh! just look at that beautiful name. 
<br><br><br>
Look at me, I'm very smooth but strong.
<br><br><br>
I start with "C", no "O", or "U", maybe "H" too.
<br><br><br>
It matters what you call me not what I sound, you see..
<br><br><br>
I'd love to see you around, but I got to go now...
<br><br><br>


What I am ???
