# The Birthmark

 I was born with a birthmark shaped like a number 9. One day I was walking down the road and then a car crashed me...BOOOM !!!! 
 
 The Doctor said It was in fatal position. A few months later, the Doctor said that I was fine and be careful. But I noticed something, the doctor looked uneasy. I thougt it was nothing and went to the bed early. 

 Early morning while going to take bath, I noticed that my birthmark number 9 shape was 8! At first I thought everything would be fine. But the next second, a thought hit my head, What if, I was cat with 9 lives and transformed into human !!! Everytime I die, birthmark number reduced by 1.
 
  Now whenever the doctor said I am in fatal position, I would laugh.  I know I have tobe careful, because I only have 9 lives.  So that it my story :)
