# Magic

I'm up in the air
Making fireworks & sparks everywhere..
<br><br><br>
All it take is magic and belief 
to make everything real..
<br><br><br>
People adore me & laugh all around,
as I make an elephant disappear..
<br><br><br>
I'm standing up, tall & proud, after the show..
<br><br><br>
Taking a bow makes me feel so proud..
<br><br><br>
Then people start shouting out a name I don't want to hear..
<br><br><br>
It's the magician who takes all credit..


What I am ???
