# Sally Jones & The Worst Day Ever
 By Anisha 


Sally opened the door and went into the house. Her dad saw and said, “What’s up with the gloomy face.”

 Sally sat on a chair  and said “Today was the worst day of my life.” “Tell me about it.” said dad. 
 
 "Well, first I thought I saw a quarter in the sidewalk crack. But it was only a penny!  
 ” That was your fault.” said dad, interrupting my story. 
 
 “What?” I said. “If you ignored the penny you wouldn’t be late,” said dad. I’d hate to admit it, but he was right. 
 
 Oh, why hadn’t I ignored the penny. Before he said anything else, I continued with my story Then I stepped in a piece of gum. 
 
 I spent so much time get my shoe unstuck, I missed the bus! So I had to walk all the way to school, with 1 shoe. 
 
 Once I got to school, my teacher had marked me absent. 
 
 “If you’d look where you were going, you wouldn’t have got your shoe stuck in gum and wouldn’t be late or marked absent,” he said. 
 
 Again he was right. “Yeah” I muttered, quietly so he wouldn’t hear me. After the teacher fixed the roaster, I sat in my seat. Benny the Bully, who sat across me, kept singing “One Sock Sally!” 
 
 Then at lunchtime, Addison spilled her chocolate milk and I stepped on it! “Again if you’d look where you were going, you wouldn't have stepped in the milk” he said. I 
 started to continue my story. 
 
 Now Benny the Bully called me Choclate Sock Sally. Then I went to the principal to get an extra shoe. But she didn't have a children's size shoe. So I had to wear a teacher sized shoe. At gym class, 1 shoe went clop, clop, clop and the other one went squish, squish, squish. 
 
 I had to sit out, while the rest of the kids got to play got to play Capture the Flag, since one shoe was to big. Capture the flag was my favorite game! After I had to give the shoe back, since it was one of the school's shoe. Then, because I got some bad grades, I had to help clean up the classroom. In result, I missed The bus, again! While walking to home I had found my shoe! But it had been stepped on. Now my pretty pink shoes were all brown and muddy. Then I came home." "Well, this might not be your worst day ever." said dad. I made a perfect zero with my mouth. "How" I asked. "I bet you had fun telling this story!" said dad with a chuckle.
